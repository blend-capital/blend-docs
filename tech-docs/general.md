# General

Blend is a permissionless liquidity protocol that allows permissionless lending pool creation and usage.

The technical documentation will encompass an overview of the core contracts involved in the protocol, as well as guides on how to deploy Blend pools, integrate with them, and more.\
\
While the technical documentation can be a good resource - we highly recommend checking out the Blend Capital GitHub for a better understanding of the protocol\
