## Overview

The backstop contract is responsible for:

Managing backstop deposits.

Enabling pools to draw backstop funds to cover bad debt and to donate interest to backstop depositors.

Managing Blend token distribution to backstop depositors and lending pool contracts.

The backstop contract is user facing - although users will be more sophisticated than lending pool users. It will be accessible at [blend.capital](https://www.blend.capital).
