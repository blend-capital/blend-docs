# Adding Assets

Pool Creators are responsible for adding assets to their pool. The assets they add will depend on the intended use case for their pool. \
\
When they add assets they must also set the [risk](risk-parameters.md) and [interest rate](interest-rates.md) parameters for the asset.&#x20;

Pool Admins have the ability to add and remove assets from the pool as well as modify their parameters. This is important to note as pool creators should opt for an Owned Pool over a Standard Pool if they will require flexibility with assets in the future.

Assets can be anything that follows the standard token interface. This includes native stellar tokens, bridged assets, or even custom tokens such as credit tokens. \
