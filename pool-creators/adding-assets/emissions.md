# Emissions

Blend lending pools within the reward zone receive BLND emissions that are distributed to lenders or borrowers in the pool. Pool's can be added to the reward zone if they have larger backstop modules than the pools currently within the reward zone. \
\
Pool creators designate which assets in their pool receive emissions and whether borrowers or lenders of those assets receive emissions.&#x20;
